<h1>My Products Card App - Redux Toolkit</h1>

Users can add product photographs, enter product names and pricing, and generate visual product cards with the application I designed. Product cards may be edited (updated) and deleted (deleted) in this project, which was created with React, Redux Toolkit, and Tailwind CSS. Furthermore, products can be sorted by price in either ascending or descending order. Redux Toolkit allows for central state management of tasks like product addition, update, and deletion. Redux stores product data, which is readily accessible to all components. Product cards are generated dynamically using the user's submitted photo, name, and set price. There are update and delete buttons on every product card. Depending on how much they cost, products can be arranged either ascending or descending. Customers can easily see products in the desired order and filter them based on pricing. The application has a search field where users may type in the name of the product to discover it easily. Using the current inventory in the store, the search is done in real-time.
